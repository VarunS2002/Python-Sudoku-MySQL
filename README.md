# Python-Sudoku-MySQL

[Downloads](https://github.com/VarunS2002/Python-Sudoku-MySQL/releases)

This is a fully fledged sudoku game written in Python using Tkinter GUI and uses MySQL database for data

Usage:

-Run the query sql script atleast once before running the sudoku program 

-Enter the properties for MySQL connection and press Connect

Note:

-The query sql script has 3 games defined by default which are soft coded in the Sudoku program

-To add more games you will need to add them in the database

-You can use the insert games tool provided to do that

-Increase the value of the gno column by 1 everytime you add a new game manually

-No code changes have to be made in the main program after adding new games 

-Adding incorrect values, rows or columns in the database may cause the program to not function correctly and result in errors
